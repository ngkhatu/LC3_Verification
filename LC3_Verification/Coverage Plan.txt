In this email, i want to talk a little bit about the coverage plan that you need to come up with on your own after finishing designing your scoreboard. 

As you know, after setting up your verification environment, you need some indicatives whether your verification scheme is "good enough" or how comprehensive your verification process is.

For that purpose, you need to create coverage groups. coverage plan is completely depended on the verification engineer, a good verification engineer will write coverage groups that will cover all possible cases, combinations, special values and sequences of the data that goes to the DUT. 

In that respect, when grading your coverage plan, we will not judge how "big" it is, we will judge how comprehensive it is ( i.e. does it cover all ALU, Memory and control operations. does it cover all the operands that one instruction might take. does it cover the reset behaviour .. etc) 

In this email, i attached a sample of a coverage plan that you might find it useful. please don't confine yourselves to it literally. it is just one approach and you might come up with more comprehensive one.
