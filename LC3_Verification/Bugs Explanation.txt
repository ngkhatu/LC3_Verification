Along with the clean DUT we have provided you with couple of Buggy DUT files. You can find these files by the name data_defs_fetch.vp data_defs_decode.vp  etc.
For Checking your Scoreboard against a DUT with bug in the fetch stage you need to rename the file data_defs_fetch.vp to data_defs.vp and compile it the DUT again.
A correct testebench should be able to find the bugs as explained below in respective buggy files
Fetch bug: 
1) When br_taken = 1, pc = taddr-1 instead of taddr.

Decode Bug: 
1) pcselect1 selects offset9 instead of offset6 for STR instructions
2) On reset, npc_out = npc_in and IR = dout instead of 0

Execute Bug:
1)DR asynchronous 
2)First 7 bits of offset9 = IR[9] instead of IR[8]

Writeback Bug:
1) address 1 to RegFile msb stuck at 0
2) DR_in switched for aluout and memout for W_control signal. 

MemAccess Bug:
1) Instead of all memory signals being high impedance, they take on different values. 

Controller Bug:
1) if branch not taken, the pc should not be updated but here it is updated to npc+1 instead of npc because enable_updatePC goes high

2) if STR instruction follows LEA with both baseR being dependent and also SR being dependent, then bypass_mem signals go high instead of bypass_alu signals.

3) For Mem_Ctrl_State = 1, next state operations based on checking complete_data = 0 instead of checking if complete_data = 1.
