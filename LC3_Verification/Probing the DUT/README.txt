                           I have attached two files, project.if.sv and project.test_top.sv in which we define an interface which is to be used for exclusively probing the signals for each block in the DUT. In this example, you will see that we have defined and instantiated a probe interface to probe the signals from the FETCH block. Please take this only as an example and try to design a probe interface on similar lines for the remaining blocks of the DUT. Note that we have defined the signals as INPUT in the interface as they are supposed to be input to the testbench. They are used only to READ or OBSERVE the internal signals from the DUT. 
                             This is just a code sample which you can refer while making the test bench environment.
